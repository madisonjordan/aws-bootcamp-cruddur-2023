This week I was ready to throw my computer out the window getting the dynamodb seed to run properly through the local postgres connection. In a final attempt after trying several things on stackoverflow, I decided to change localhost to 127.0.0.1 in the postgres connection url and it worked. I can't say I'm happy about it, but at least it works now.
