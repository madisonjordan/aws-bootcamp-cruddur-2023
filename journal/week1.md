## Weekly Summary
<!--Summary Journal Entry-->


#### Reflection
<!--Thoughts/Feelings so far.-->
 I definitely spent more time on the challenges for Docker than I had hoped to. I should have worked on the required homework more first.

## Homework Challenges

### Run Docker Images on Local Machine

Installed Docker Desktop:

Built Docker Images:

### Pushing an Image to a Container Registry

Build image to push to `madisonjordan` account on Dockerhub:
```
docker build -t madisonjordan/crudder-backend:1.0.0 .
```

I then pushed the built image using the Docker Desktop application while logged in. Used instead of using the CLI commands for `docker login` and `docker push`. 

Dockerhub:

### Dockerfile Best Practices

- [X] Use multi-stage build
- [X] Reduce vulnerabilities in built image
- [X] Create non-root user in Dockerfile

Updating for the Dockerfile best practices so I could get the backend image to work while using a small base image with less vulnerabilities was harder than expected. I spent a few hours more than I had hoped to.

#### Multi-Stage Build

| Image | Original | New | 
| ------| ---------: | ----: |
| Frontend |   1.19 GB |   |
| Backend |    129.48 MB  |  120.28 MB  |

Not a huge difference in the size of the backend final image when switching to Ubuntu:20.04 as the base image, but it was already pretty small to begin with. 

#### Vulnerability Scanning

scanning from docker CLI using Snyk
```
docker scan -f Dockerfile cruddur-backend:1.0.0     
```
