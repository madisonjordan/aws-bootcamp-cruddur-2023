### Pushing an Image to a Container Registry

Build image to push to `madisonjordan` account on Dockerhub:
```
docker build -t madisonjordan/crudder-backend:1.0.0 .
```

I then pushed the built image using the Docker Desktop application while logged in instead of using the cli commands for `docker login` and `docker push`. 


Dockerhub:
