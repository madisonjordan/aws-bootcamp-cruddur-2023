## Knowledge Transfer

In CloudFormation templates:

YAML compiles down to JSON so,

```yaml
VPC: 
# ...

IGW:
  Type: AWS::EC2::InternetGateway
  Properties:
    VpcId:
      Ref: VPC
```

is equivalent to

```json
VPC: 
# ...

IGW:
  Type: AWS::EC2::InternetGateway
  Properties: {VpcId: {Ref: "VPC"}}
```

You can also use CloudFormation's various functions to reference previously defined resources using `Ref`, `GetAtt`, etc
```
VPC: 
# ...

IGW:
  Type: AWS::EC2::InternetGateway
  Properties:
    Tags:
      - Key: Name
        Value: CruddurVPC

AttachIGW:
  Type: AWS::EC2::VPCGatewayAttachment
  Properties:
    VpcId:
    # Get ID from VPC 
      Ref: VPC
    # Get ID of previously defined Resource "IGW" using CloudFormation function `!Ref`
    InternetGatewayId: !Ref IGW
```
