## Weekly Summary
<!--Summary Journal Entry-->


#### Reflection
<!--Thoughts/Feelings so far.-->
This week was okay. I didn't have any trouble with the bash scripts. I changed them to be more modular so I didn't have to use seperate utility scripts for frontend and backend.


#### Challenges
<!-- Challenges you've had this week in completing your tasks. How you might solve them or what you did to solve them. -->

I had a problem in Gitpod where the frontend and backend ports upon a docker-compose would be stuck on "detecting." 
I attempted to use an earlier gitpod workspace image, but the issue persisted. I looked at the Gitpod docs on ports [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/references/gitpod-cli#ports) and ran the command `gp ports list`. It showed the frontend and backend ports listed as "open on localhost" instead of "open (public)". 
I used a command to open the preview url `gp preview $(gp url 3000) --external`, as shown in the Gitpod docs [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/references/gitpod-cli#preview), and was able to continue with development.

## Knowledge Transfer

#### Key Takeaways
<!-- Key takeaways for this week -->
- It's better to use the ECR for pulling images than DockerHub when launching services from a container registry.
- Due to the "one process/concern per container" design, there is no benefit to using multithreaded webservers that were used on virtual machines, such as Gunicorn. You should scale out the containers as needed rather than have all the processes run on one container needlessly. 
  - In a container, consider a vCPU as a CPU with the provisioned cycles/Ghz rather than thinking of it in terms of threads and hyperthreading.
- Most of the logging, scaling, etc is built into FARGATE's ochestration itself. (The infrastructure for FARGATE is managed by AWS rather than needing to be setup by the user.)
- On FARGATE, you can only use AWSVPC mode. ECS you can use host, bridge, etc. 
  - In AWSVPC network mode, you can make different security groups per service on the ENI. 
- Service Connect expands on App Mesh and runs Cloud Map in the background to make configuring Envoy (proxy) more manageable at scale. 


#### Questions
<!-- Questions on the materials or concepts with their answers, if available.-->
Q. Why does X-Ray need to be on both services?

## Required Homework  

### ECR Repo
I created a repo for cruddur-python, but I didn't want to add my account id in the commited dockerfile and I was concerned about having to maintain that container myself to periodically update security vulnerabilities since the last pushed tag.

Instead, I used the [Docker's official images in the public registry on ECR](https://gallery.ecr.aws/docker/).
It appeared to build correctly and work with the health-check. 

I still created and pushed the private repo for backend-flask.
