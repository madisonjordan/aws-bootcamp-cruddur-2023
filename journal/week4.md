## Weekly Summary
<!--Summary Journal Entry-->


#### Reflection
<!--Thoughts/Feelings so far.-->
I really liked using the [coloring for the terminal print statements](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5947742/how-to-change-the-output-color-of-echo-in-linux). I'm going to use that in the future for readability.
Postgres wasn't that different from what I remember using sqlite, so the concepts weren't that difficult for me. 

#### Challenges
<!-- Challenges you've had this week in completing your tasks. How you might solve them or what you did to solve them. -->
Connecting to the RDS was somewhat challenging, but I figured it out quickly enough. I wasn't able to connect at first because I didn't create the inbound security group rule for postgres.
