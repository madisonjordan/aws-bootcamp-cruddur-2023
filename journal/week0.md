## Weekly Summary
<!--Summary Journal Entry-->
- Read outline
- Organized course on Notion for tracking

#### Reflection
<!--Thoughts/Feelings so far.-->
I feel a bit anxious about starting the course and figuring out what to do first, but setting up my tasks and the calendar on Notion has helped feel like it's more manageable. I feel the content is within my abilities and I'll have to let go of my perfectionism and do my best. I think I know enough to get started with everything despite not being an expert in all of the concepts. 
I don't want to spend excessive amounts of time working on prequisites out of fear that I won't be able to succeed if I don't know everything. I'm hoping to become more flexible in that respect and make an attempt to see if tasks are within my abilities and discovering what further information I will need to succeed if not. 

I successfully redeemed the AWS credit voucher from the student portal, so I'm pretty pleased with myself. 

#### Challenges
<!-- Challenges you've had this week in completing your tasks. How you might solve them or what you did to solve them. -->
I was slightly concerned about the spending but the costs were broken down really well in the docs and I also successfully added a prepaid gift card to my AWS account for billing.


#### Next Steps
TBD

## Knowledge Transfer

#### Key Takeaways
<!-- Key takeaways for this week -->
- Understand the business concerns before deciding on technical solutions
   - requirements, risks, assumptions, constraints
   - "Iron Triangle" - (pick 2) fast, good, or cheap
- Be able to communicate across teams and stakeholders
   - have a "common dictionary". see TOGAF and AWS Well-Architectured Tool Framework
   - documentation to be able to communicate key features to laymen
   - architectural diagrams help communicate with almost anyone  
- Setup billing alarms and budget in AWS

#### Questions
<!-- Questions on the materials or concepts with their answers, if available.-->
Q. What is the difference between the different architectural designs? e.g. conceptual, logical, physical

## Required Homework 

## AWS

### Use CloudShell

At first I had trouble figuring out how to find the cloudshell for my region, but then I went back in the video and it said that the console doesn't appear for every region. Apparently us-west-1 doesn't have one, but us-west-2 does. Also I couldn't change the region while I was on the billing page. 

us-west-1:<br>

us-west-2:<br>

### AWS CLI

#### Install AWS CLI

I didn't have any issues generating the IAM or access key for AWS and installing the CLI by pasting the tasks into the `gitpod.yml` from the week0 branch instructions, which were very helpful. However, I did have minor issues with pushing the `gitpod.yml`, which I fixed through changing the public repo permissions for the GitHub integration. After that, it gave another error when I pushed my changes (which I don't recall what it said), but I checked my repo on GitHub and it seemed to push fine anyway. When I started it up, it automatically ran all the commands defined in the tasks within the yaml that I had commited.

While I was watching the video I forgot to put the environment variable for the secrets and was stuck for a minute on being able to figure out how to relaunch gitpod since it didn't close the workspace (it complained that the workspace was still open and I didn't want to launch a 2nd one) after I used the `gp env` command and closed the tab. I figured it out from somewhere in the menu where it said "stop workspace." It was fine after that and gave the expected response from the `aws sts get-caller-identity` command.

#### Create Budget and Billing Alarm

I thought it how you could still create a billing alarm from the AWS CLI since from the AWS website, you have to be in N Virgina (us-east-1) to create billing. Or that's what I thought. 

Creating the budget from the UI was much easier. 

I had to remember not to commit my TopicARN and email since I saw everyone was having issues with that.

### Conceptual Design

### Logical Design
I did the napkin for the wrong one but I spent so long on it that I'm just going to put it here anyway. 

Apparently I don't understand the difference between the conceptual design and logical design otherwise I would have noticed much earlier that the video was for the logical one and the instructions said to do the napkin for the conceptual one.
