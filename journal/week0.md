## Week of 2023-02-06 
<!--Summary Journal Entry-->
- Read outline
- Organized course on Notion for tracking
- Completed various items in task list (see above)

#### Reflection
<!--Thoughts/Feelings so far.-->
I feel a bit anxious about starting the course and figuring out what to do first, but setting up my tasks and the calendar on Notion has helped feel like it's more manageable. I feel the content is within my abilities and I'll have to let go of my perfectionism and do my best. I think I know enough to get started with everything despite not being an expert in all of the concepts. 
I don't want to spend excessive amounts of time working on prequisites out of fear that I won't be able to succeed if I don't know everything. I'm hoping to become more flexible in that respect and make an attempt to see if tasks are within my abilities and discovering what further information I will need to succeed if not. 

I successfully redeemed the AWS credit voucher from the student portal, so I'm pretty pleased with myself. 

#### Challenges
<!-- Challenges you've had this week in completing your tasks. How you might solve them or what you did to solve them. -->
I was slightly concerned about the spending but the costs were broken down really well in the docs and I also successfully added a prepaid gift card to my AWS account for billing.

#### Next Steps
TBD
